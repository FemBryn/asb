# ASB

Some scripts to work with ASB and BAEV files

You'll have to run this with Python yourself for now, use `asb_to_json` or `json_to_asb` with the proper arguments like so:

```py
import converter

converter.asb_to_json("Lynel.root.asb", baev_path="Lynel.root.baev")
```

Sorry for the lack of command line support, but hopefully this is not too hard to figure out :P
